# Workout!

This package is designed to be used while working out. It gives a list of 
workouts that are saved in the `data` directory. If you want to add more 
workouts you can easily use the `import/example.yml` file as a model for yours.

The basic idea is starting with a warmup with time provided then doing 
20/20/20/60 intervals. So it comes out to 60 seconds of work and 60 seconds 
of rest, but you are doing three different exercises for each set.
